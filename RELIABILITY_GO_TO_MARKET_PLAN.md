    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitoring_keywords = [

            "trading app crashed", "orders not executing", "can't login"
        ]
        self.acquisition_campaigns = {}
    
    async def monitor_competitor_health(self):

            "zerodha.com/forum", "news APIs"
        ])
        
        if outage_confidence > 0.8:

            "whatsapp_broadcast", "sms_blast", "push_notifications"
        ])
```

    Ultra-fast onboarding for users fleeing competitor outages
    """
    
    async def whatsapp_kyc_flow(self, phone_number):
        conversation = [
            "🚨 Quick KYC for immediate trading access:",
            "📸 Send PAN card photo",
            "📱 Send Aadhaar selfie", 
            "🏦 Bank account details",
            "✅ KYC complete! Start trading now."
        ]
        
        # Process in parallel with AI verification
        kyc_result = await self.ai_document_verification(documents)
        
        if kyc_result.confidence > 0.95:
            await self.instant_account_activation(phone_number)
            return "🎉 Account active! Send 'BUY RELIANCE 100' to start"
```

### **Crisis Onboarding Experience**
